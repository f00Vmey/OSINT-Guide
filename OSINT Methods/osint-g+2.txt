Introduction to OSINT Investigations

Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) is the practice of gathering and analyzing publicly available information from diverse sources to generate actionable insights. It is widely used in cybersecurity, law enforcement, journalism, and private investigations. OSINT helps uncover hidden connections, track digital footprints, and verify facts without intrusive or illegal methods.

How OSINT Works

Define Objectives - Establish a clear goal for the investigation (e.g., identifying an individual, tracking cyber threats, verifying claims).

Information Gathering - Collect data from multiple open sources, including search engines, social media, forums, government databases, and leaked data repositories.

Analysis and Correlation - Cross-reference and analyze the collected data to identify patterns, connections, and anomalies.

Verification - Authenticate information to ensure accuracy and prevent misinformation.

Reporting - Compile findings into a structured report with sources, analysis, and conclusions.
