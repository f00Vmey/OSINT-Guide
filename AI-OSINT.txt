OSINT and Facial Recognition AI
Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) can be leveraged in various ways using an array of tools.
In this section, I will cover how facial recognition AI can be used to extract valuable information about individuals, along with other OSINT techniques.
For example, imagine you are conducting OSINT on a user named Jane Doe and wish to uncover more details about her. One potential method is to analyze her friends’ posts. However, manually searching through thousands of posts would be highly impractical. An OSINT investigator would need extensive free time to sift through all the data manually. But what if there was a way to automate this process?

1. ChatGPT & OSINT

Automated Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) refers to the practice of utilizing tools and scripts to systematically collect, analyze, and correlate publicly available data from diverse sources. Rather than manually searching for information, automation enhances both the speed and scalability of OSINT operations.
How Automated OSINT Works:

Data Collection – Utilizing web scrapers, APIs, and search engines to gather information from social media, websites, databases, and even dark web sources.
Data Processing – Filtering and structuring raw data into readable formats, removing duplicates, and normalizing datasets for easier analysis.
Analysis & Correlation – Cross-referencing multiple data sources to identify patterns, connections, and hidden relationships.
Visualization & Reporting – Presenting findings in clear, digestible formats using dashboards, graphs, and structured reports.

How to Conduct Automated OSINT:

Define Objectives
What information do you need? (e.g., emails, social media profiles, IP addresses)
Who or what is the target? (Individual, company, network)
Use OSINT Tools & Techniques
Search Engines: Google Dorking (advanced search queries)
Data Scraping: Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium for web data extraction
Social Media Mining: OSINT Framework, Maltego, Sherlock (for username enumeration)
WHOIS & Domain Analysis: WHOIS lookups, Sublist3r for subdomain enumeration
IP & Geolocation Tracking: Shodan, Censys, ipinfo.io
Dark Web Monitoring: Ahmia, TOR search engines
Automate with Scripts
Python scripting using requests, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, or Scrapy
Bash scripting utilizing curl, grep, and awk
API automation using OSINT API services such as VirusTotal, HaveIBeenPwned
Analyze & Store Data
Utilize Excel, Neo4j, Maltego, or ElasticSearch for data processing and visualization.
Cross-reference multiple sources to verify information.
Pre-built OSINT scripts can also be found in dedicated directories for alternative solutions.

Facial Recognition for OSINT

If you intend to use facial recognition technology to uncover information about an individual, websites like Lenso.ai (https://lenso.ai) can be incredibly useful. Lenso.ai allows users to conduct reverse image searches, which can aid in identifying individuals, finding locations by comparing images, and filtering results based on different domains and keywords. This makes it an effective tool for tracking down specific locations or individuals.
Another similar tool is PimEyes (https://pimeyes.com), which offers comparable facial recognition capabilities. These tools are particularly valuable for investigating online identities and tracking digital footprints.

Social Engineering & ChatGPT
While social engineering tactics do not strictly fall under OSINT, they are commonly used by hackers to gain trust and extract valuable information from targets. ChatGPT can be used to craft convincing phishing emails or other deceptive messages to manipulate individuals into revealing sensitive data. This demonstrates the potential dual-use nature of AI in cybersecurity—both as a defensive tool and as a method exploited by malicious actors.
By integrating automated OSINT techniques with AI-driven tools, investigators can significantly enhance their ability to collect and analyze data efficiently while minimizing manual effort.
